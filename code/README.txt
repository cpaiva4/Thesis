The data to run these files is proprietary of the University of Coimbra

Files:
cnn_ff_lab.py: Trains convolutional neural network + feedforward
grid_search.py: Has the code to perform a pseudo grid search. Since a grid search would take too much time given the computational ressources available, a bootom-up approach was used to train the parameters
net_tester_lab.py: Tests the model and gives measurements (fpr, alerts, etc) to the grid search
test_with_data_vis.py: Tests the neural network and produces charts and measurements
utils.py: Cross-file utilities
